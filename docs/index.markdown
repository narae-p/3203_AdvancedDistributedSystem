**Paxos** algorithms are a family of consensus algorithms (or protocols) that are used in distributed systems to achieve consensus in the presence of crash failures.
These protocols are infamously difficult to understand, mainly due to the various states that have to be maintained on servers that have varying roles in the execution of the protocol.
Paxos consensus protocols are generally used to implement strongly-consistent replication in distributed systems that run on asynchronous environments.

In this website, we explain how the Paxos protocols work using easy to understand invariants and code. It is easy to understand because the states that are maintained
by servers with different roles are shown explicitly and the correctness of the state changes are described using invariants that hold before and after the state changes.
In addition, a high-level and complete [Python implementation]](/code/) is provided.

While the main proofs are focused on the basic Multi-Paxos protocol, other variants of the Paxos protocol
are explained under [variants](/variants/), especially underlining what makes them noteworthy.
